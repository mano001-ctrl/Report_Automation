# Report Automation

**Report Automation** is a Python framework designed to simplify the creation, formatting, and distribution of recurring business and financial reports. By integrating data extraction, template-driven document generation, and automated delivery, this repository helps teams reduce manual effort and ensure consistency in periodic reporting.

## Key Features

* **Data Connectors:** Extract data from Excel, CSV, SQL databases, and REST APIs with modular connector scripts.
* **Template-Driven Generation:** Leverage Jinja2 templates for Word (`.docx`) and PowerPoint (`.pptx`) to produce professional reports.
* **Automated Styling:** Apply corporate branding and formatting—tables, charts, headers/footers—programmatically.
* **Scheduler Integration:** Run reports on a schedule via cron (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows).
* **Flexible Delivery:** Send completed reports via email (SMTP) or Slack with built-in notifier modules.
* **Extensible:** Add new data sources, report layouts, or delivery channels with minimal setup.
